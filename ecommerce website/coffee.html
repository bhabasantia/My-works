    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong> Coffee</strong> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain <i style="color: blue;"> Coffea</i> species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into a powder and typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong> Roasting </strong> coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.</p>
